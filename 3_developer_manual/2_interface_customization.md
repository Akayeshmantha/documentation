#Interface Customization

Almost the entire codebase of NIMBLE can be customized via the frontend-service.
The relevant configuration options are commented in detail in the Angular globals file: [https://github.com/nimble-platform/frontend-service/blob/master/src/app/globals.ts](https://github.com/nimble-platform/frontend-service/blob/master/src/app/globals.ts)

The remaining customization and settings are done via environment variables and template files listed in the README of each repository.
