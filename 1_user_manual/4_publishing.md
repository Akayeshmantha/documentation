# Publishing

One can publish a product/service or a logistics service.

When publishing a product/service the user first has to find a suitable category by using the search bar or traversing through the ontology trees. Multiple categories can be selected for one product/service. After clicking Continue the user has to enter the required data and can define a variety of properties, configure the price incl. discounts, add documents, etc.

When publishing a logistics service the user is directly taken to the input where various parts of the logistics chain - such as Transport, Warehousing, Order Picking, etc. - can be defined with fine-grained options on one page.

Both offer the Bulk upload in order to get a spreadsheet-based alternative for faster export/import.
