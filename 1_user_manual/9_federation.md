#Federation

Enabling the federation allows for searching and doing business across separate NIMBLE instances.
Apart from longer loading times due to the data aggregation this process is completely seemless and all features work as usual.
The origin of each product/service is marked with a small database icon and the instance name in case it has not been retrieved locally.
The dashboard can only list the processes of one instance at a time so make sure to check the correct one.
