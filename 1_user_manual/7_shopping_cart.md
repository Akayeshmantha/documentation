#Shopping Cart

The shopping cart allows for collecting multiple products/services from one or more seller(s) that can be negotiated / ordered at the same time.
Terms can either be applied to the whole cart or adjusted piece by piece.
After pressing Negotiate / Order All all relevant business processes get generated automatically and products/services are groups in case they are sold by the same party.
