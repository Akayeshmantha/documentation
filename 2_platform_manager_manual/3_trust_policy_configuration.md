# Trust Policy Configuration

The trust policy configuration allows for adjusting the metrics applied when calculating the trust scores of a company globally on the platform level.
Therefore, the weights and limits (expressions) of pre-defined metrics can be changed and a recalculation and reindexing can be triggered.
Details on the syntax and formats can be found in the tooltip on the page.
